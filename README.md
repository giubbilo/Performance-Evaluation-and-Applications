# Performance-Evaluation-and-Applications

Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹

This is my repo for the Performance Evaluation and Applications course at Politecnico di Milano (a.y. 23/24).

You can find all the assignments and all the solutions. Most of them have been written using *Matlab* and some using JMT (Java Modelling Tool) developed by Politecnico di Milano & Imperial College London.
